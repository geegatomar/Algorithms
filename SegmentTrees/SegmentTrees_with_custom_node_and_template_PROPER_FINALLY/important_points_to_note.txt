NOTE: VERY IMPORTANT POINTS (for Segment Trees)

1. This implementation of segment trees is 1 - indexed
2. Make sure to pass the vector by reference, otherwise it gives TLE
3. Take case of point updates and range updates, and point assigns and range assigns
4. After doing updates, always remember to merge both child nodes to get my node's value
5. Very Imp to initialize lazy vector to zero
6. Note the "push" for range assigns and range updates are also very different
